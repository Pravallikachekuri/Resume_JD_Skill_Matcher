# 📄 Resume_JD_Skill_Matcher + LLM Judge + ✉️ Email Notifier

A powerful Streamlit web app that automates resume screening by matching resumes against job descriptions using advanced NLP and LLM models. It scores, judges, and categorizes candidates, then notifies them via email — streamlining recruitment workflows with AI!

## Features

- **Resume Parsing**: Extracts text from PDF resumes using PDFMiner, PyMuPDF, and OCR (EasyOCR) for high accuracy.
- **Skill Extraction**: Uses SpaCy to identify and highlight technical skills from resumes.
- **AI-Powered Matching & Scoring**: Utilizes Groq LLM (via `agno` library) to score how well a resume matches a job description (scale 0-100).
- **Automated Judgement**: LLM judges whether a resume is a good match and provides a brief reason.
- **Candidate Categorization**: Categorizes candidates into Low, Medium, or High match buckets based on score.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends customized email updates to candidates about their application status using Gmail SMTP.
- **Interactive Streamlit UI**: Easy drag-and-drop uploads for job descriptions and multiple resumes, with real-time progress and results display.
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Implements retry mechanisms for Groq API rate limits.
